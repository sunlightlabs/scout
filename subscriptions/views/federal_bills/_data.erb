    Notices of when a bill is scheduled for floor debate come from the <a href="http://majorityleader.gov/floor/daily.html">House Republican Majority Leader</a>, and <a href="https://democrats.senate.gov/floor/">Senate Democratic Caucus</a>. This information is usually published a few days in advance and can change rapidly.
