# An interest, e.g. "intellectual property". 
#
# ## "search" interests
#
# Alice searches for an interest of hers, "intellectual property", filters for
# "Bills in Congress," and signs up for notifications. This creates a "search"
# interest. The interest is *in* "intellectual property". It also creates a
# single subscription, whose adapter is the `federal_bills` adapter. Alice will
# receive notifications about new items related to her interest from the data
# source for that adapter, Sunlight's Congress API.
#
# If Alice did not filter for "Bills in Congress", Scout creates a subscription
# for each adapter that is a "search-type" adapter (currently hardcoded).
#
# ## "item" interests
#
# Alice navigates to the page of a single item, e.g. a bill, and signs up for
# notifications. This creates an "item" interest. The interest is *in* the item.
# It also creates subscriptions to adapters for things related to the item, like
# votes, notices of upcoming hearings, etc. Alice will receive notifications
# about new items related to the item from the data sources for those adapters.
#
# ## "feed" interests
#
# Alice imports an RSS feed into Scout. This creates a "feed" interest. The
# interest is *in* the feed. It also creates a single subscription, whose
# adapter is the `feed` adapter. Alice will receive notifications about new
# items in the feed. (In other words, this is RSS-to-Email.)
#
# ## "tag" interests
#
# These interests have no subscriptions and are specially handled. See the
# `Delivery` class for more discussion.
#
# Read `Interest#subscriptions_for` for more understanding.
